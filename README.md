# 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Classification  

This project focuses on **classifying Alzheimer's disease stages** using MRI brain images with a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for enhanced performance. The dataset is categorized into different stages:  

- **Non-Demented**  
- **Very Mild Demented**  
- **Mild Demented**  
- **Moderate Demented**  

## 📌 Features  

- **Data Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and dataset organization.  
- **Visualization**: Displaying brain scans for different dementia stages.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN architecture for accurate stage classification.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, PIL  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

## 📂 Dataset  

The dataset consists of MRI brain scans categorized into dementia stages. Ensure the dataset is structured properly before running the notebook.  

📌 Future Improvements

Fine-tuning the CNN architecture for better classification performance.
Expanding the dataset for improved generalization.
